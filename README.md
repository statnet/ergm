An integrated set of tools to analyze and simulate networks based on exponential-family random graph models (ERGMs). 'ergm' is a part of the Statnet suite of packages for network analysis.

## Public and Private repositories

To facilitate open development of the package while giving the core developers an opportunity to publish on their developments before opening them up for general use, this project comprises two repositories:
* A public repository `statnet/ergm`
* A private repository `statnet/ergm-private`

The intention is that all developments in `statnet/ergm-private` will eventually make their way into `statnet/ergm` and onto CRAN.

Developers and Contributing Users to the Statnet Project should read https://statnet.github.io/private/ for information about the relationship between the public and the private repository and the workflows involved.
