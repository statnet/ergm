\title{A soft constraint to adjust the sampled distribution for
dyad-level noise with known perturbation probabilities}
\usage{
# dyadnoise(p01, p10)
}
\arguments{
\item{p01, p10}{can both be scalars or both be adjacency matrices of the same dimension as that of the
LHS network giving these probabilities.}
}
\description{
A soft constraint to adjust the sampled distribution for
dyad-level noise with known perturbation probabilities
}
\details{
It is assumed that the observed LHS network is a noisy observation of
some unobserved true network, with \code{p01} giving the dyadwise
probability of erroneously observing a tie where the true network
had a non-tie and \code{p10} giving the dyadwise probability of
erroneously observing a nontie where the true network had a tie.
