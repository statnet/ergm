\description{
Degree to the 3/2 power
}
\details{
This term adds one network statistic to the model equaling the sum over
the actors of each actor's degree taken to the 3/2 power (or,
equivalently, multiplied by its square root). This term is an
undirected analog to the terms of Snijders et al. (2010), equations
(11) and (12). This term can only be used with undirected networks.
