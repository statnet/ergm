\arguments{
\item{nsteps}{Number of geometric bridges to use.}

\item{MCMC.burnin}{Number of proposals before any MCMC sampling is done. It
typically is set to a fairly large number.}

\item{MCMC.interval}{Number of proposals between sampled statistics.}

\item{MCMC.samplesize}{Number of network statistics, randomly drawn from a
given distribution on the set of all networks, returned by the
Metropolis-Hastings algorithm.}

\item{obs.MCMC.burnin, obs.MCMC.interval, obs.MCMC.samplesize}{The \code{obs}
versions of these arguments are for the unobserved data simulation
algorithm.}

\item{MCMC.prop}{Specifies the proposal (directly) and/or
a series of "hints" about the structure of the model being
sampled. The specification is in the form of a one-sided formula
with hints separated by \code{+} operations. If the LHS exists and is
a string, the proposal to be used is selected directly.

A common and default "hint" is \code{~sparse}, indicating
that the network is sparse and that the sample should put roughly
equal weight on selecting a dyad with or without a tie as a
candidate for toggling.}

\item{MCMC.prop.weights}{Specifies the proposal
distribution used in the MCMC Metropolis-Hastings algorithm.  Possible
choices depending on selected \code{reference} and \code{constraints}
arguments of the \code{\link[=ergm]{ergm()}} function, but often include \code{"TNT"}
and \code{"random"}, and the \code{"default"} is to use the one with the
highest priority available.}

\item{MCMC.prop.args}{An alternative, direct way of
specifying additional arguments to proposal.}

\item{warn.dyads}{Whether or not a warning should be issued when sample
space constraints render the observed number of dyads ill-defined. Now defunct: use \code{options(ergm.logLik.warn_dyads=...)} instead.}

\item{MCMC.init.maxedges}{Maximum number of edges expected in network.}

\item{MCMC.packagenames}{Names of packages in which to look for change
statistic functions in addition to those autodetected. This argument should
not be needed outside of very strange setups.}

\item{term.options}{A list of additional arguments to be passed to term initializers. See \code{\link[=term.options]{? term.options}}.}

\item{seed}{Seed value (integer) for the random number generator.  See
\code{\link[base]{set.seed}}.}

\item{parallel}{Number of threads in which to run the sampling. Defaults to
0 (no parallelism). See the entry on \link[=ergm-parallel]{parallel processing}
for details and troubleshooting.}

\item{parallel.type}{API to use for parallel processing. Supported values
are \code{"MPI"} and \code{"PSOCK"}. Defaults to using the \code{parallel}
package with PSOCK clusters. See \code{\link{ergm-parallel}}}

\item{parallel.version.check}{Logical: If TRUE, check that the version of
\code{\link[=ergm-package]{ergm}} running on the slave nodes is the same as
that running on the master node.}

\item{parallel.inherit.MT}{Logical: If TRUE, slave nodes and
processes inherit the \code{\link[=set.MT_terms]{set.MT_terms()}} setting.}
