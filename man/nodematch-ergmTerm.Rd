\arguments{
\item{attr}{quantitative attribute (see Specifying Vertex attributes and Levels (\code{?nodal_attributes}) for details.)}

\item{diff}{specify if the term has uniform or differential homophily}

\item{keep}{deprecated}

\item{levels}{this optional argument controls which levels of the attribute
attributes and Levels (\code{\link[=nodal_attributes]{?nodal_attributes}}) for details.)}

\item{form}{character how to aggregate tie values in a valued ERGM}
}
\description{
When \code{diff=FALSE} , this term adds one network statistic
to the model, which counts the number of edges \eqn{(i,j)} for which
\code{attr(i)==attr(j)} . This is also called \dQuote{uniform homophily}, because each group is assumed to have the same propensity for within-group ties. When multiple attribute names are given, the
statistic counts only ties for which all of the attributes
match. When \code{diff=TRUE} , \eqn{p} network statistics are added
to the model, where \eqn{p} is the number of unique values of the
\code{attr} attribute. The \eqn{k} th such statistic counts the
number of edges \eqn{(i,j)} for which \verb{attr(i) == attr(j) == value(k)} , where \code{value(k)} is the \eqn{k} th
smallest unique value of the \code{attr} attribute. This is also called \dQuote{differential homophily}, because each group is allowed to have a unique propensity for within-group ties. Note that a statistical test of uniform vs. differential homophily should be conducted using the ANOVA function.

By default, matches on all levels \eqn{k} are
counted. This works for both
\code{diff=TRUE} and \code{diff=FALSE} .

\note{
The argument \code{keep} is retained for backwards compatibility and may be
removed in a future version. When both \code{keep} and \code{levels} are passed,
\code{levels} overrides \code{keep}.
