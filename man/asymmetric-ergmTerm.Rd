\usage{
# binary: asymmetric(attr=NULL, diff=FALSE, keep=NULL, levels=NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{attr}{quantitative attribute (see Specifying Vertex attributes and Levels (\code{?nodal_attributes}) for details.) If specified, only symmetric pairs that match on the vertex attribute are counted.}

\item{diff}{Used in the same way as for the \code{nodematch} term. (See \code{nodematch} (\code{?nodematch}) for details.)}

\item{keep}{deprecated}

\item{level}{Used in the same way as for the \code{nodematch} term. (See \code{nodematch} (\code{?nodematch}) for details.)}

\description{
Asymmetric dyads
}
\details{
This term adds one network statistic to the model equal to the
number of pairs of actors for which exactly one of
\eqn{(i{\rightarrow}j)}{(i,j)} or \eqn{(j{\rightarrow}i)}{(j,i)} exists.
}
\note{
This term can only be used with directed networks.

The argument \code{keep} is retained for backwards compatibility and may be
removed in a future version. When both \code{keep} and \code{levels} are passed,
\code{levels} overrides \code{keep}.
