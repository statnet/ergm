\title{Concurrent node count for the second mode in a bipartite network}
\usage{
# binary: b2concurrent(by=NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{by}{This optional argument specifie a vertex attribute (see Specifying Vertex attributes and Levels (\code{?nodal_attributes}) for details);
it functions just like the \code{by} argument of the \code{b2degree} term.}
}
\description{
Concurrent node count for the second mode in a bipartite (aka two-mode) network
}
\details{
This term adds one
network statistic to the model, equal to the number of nodes in the second
mode of the network with degree 2 or higher. The second mode of a bipartite
network object is sometimes known as the "event" mode.
Without the optional argument, this statistic is equivalent to \code{b2mindegree(2)}.
}
\note{
This term can only be used with undirected bipartite networks.
