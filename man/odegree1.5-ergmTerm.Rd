\title{Out-degree to the 3/2 power}
\usage{
# binary: odegree1.5
}
\description{
Out-degree to the 3/2 power
}
\details{
This term adds one network statistic to the model equaling the sum
over the actors of each actor's outdegree taken to the 3/2 power
(or, equivalently, multiplied by its square root). This term is
analogous to the term of Snijders et al. (2010), equation (12). This
term can only be used with directed networks.
