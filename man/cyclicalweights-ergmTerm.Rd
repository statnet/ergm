\title{Cyclical weights}
\usage{
# valued: cyclicalweights(twopath="min", combine="max", affect="min")
}
\arguments{
\item{twopath}{the minimum of the constituent dyads ( \code{"min"} ) or their geometric mean
( \code{"geomean"} )}

\item{combine}{the maximum of the
2-path strengths ( \code{"max"} ) or their sum ( \code{"sum"} )}

\item{affected}{the minimum of the focus dyad and the
combined strength of the two paths ( \code{"min"} ) or their
geometric mean ( \code{"geomean"} )}
}
\description{
Cyclical weights
}
\details{
This statistic implements the cyclical weights
statistic, like that defined by Krivitsky (2012), Equation 13,
but with the focus dyad being \eqn{y_{j,i}} rather than
\eqn{y_{i,j}} . For each option,
the first (and the default) is more stable but also more
conservative, while the second is more sensitive but more likely
to induce a multimodal distribution of networks.
