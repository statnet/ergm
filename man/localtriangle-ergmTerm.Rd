\title{Triangles within neighborhoods}
\usage{
# binary: localtriangle(x)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{an undirected
network or an symmetric adjacency matrix that specifies whether the two nodes
are in the same neighborhood. Note that \code{triangle} , with or without an argument, is a
special case of \code{localtriangle} .}
}
\description{
Triangles within neighborhoods
}
\details{
This term adds one statistic to the model equal to the number of triangles
in the network between nodes "close to" each other. For an undirected
network, a local triangle is defined to be any set of three edges between
nodal pairs \eqn{\{(i,j), (j,k), (k,i)\}} that are in the same neighborhood.
For a directed network, a triangle is defined as any set of three edges
\eqn{(i{\rightarrow}j), (j{\rightarrow}k)}{(i,j), (j,k)} and either
\eqn{(k{\rightarrow}i)} or \eqn{(k{\leftarrow}i)} where again all nodes are
within the same neighborhood.
