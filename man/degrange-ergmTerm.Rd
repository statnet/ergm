\usage{
# binary: degrange(from, to=+Inf, by=NULL, homophily=FALSE, levels=NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{from, to}{vectors of distinct integers. If one of the vectors have length 1, it is recycled to the length of the other. Otherwise, it must have the same length.}

\item{by, homophily}{the optional argument \code{by} specifies a vertex attribute (see Specifying
Vertex attributes and Levels (\code{?nodal_attributes}) for details).
If this is specified and \code{homophily} is \code{TRUE} ,
then degrees are calculated using the subnetwork consisting of only
edges whose endpoints have the same value of the \code{by} attribute.
If \code{by} is specified and
\code{homophily} is \code{FALSE} (the default), then separate degree range
statistics are calculated for nodes having each separate
value of the attribute.}

\item{levels}{TODO (See Specifying Vertex
attributes and Levels (\code{\link[=nodal_attributes]{?nodal_attributes}}) for details.)}

\description{
Degree range
}
\details{
This term adds one
network statistic to the model for each element of \code{from} (or \code{to} ); the \eqn{i} th
such statistic equals the number of nodes in the network of degree
greater than or equal to
\code{from[i]} but strictly less than \code{to[i]} , i.e. with edges
in semiopen interval \verb{[from,to)} .

This term can only be used with undirected networks; for directed networks
see \code{idegrange} and \code{odegrange} . This term can be used
with bipartite networks, and will count nodes of both first and second mode in
the specified degree range. To count only nodes of the first mode ("actors"), use \code{b1degrange}
and to count only those fo the second mode ("events"), use \code{b2degrange} .
