\title{Mixing matrix for k-stars centered on the second mode of a bipartite network}
\usage{
# binary: b2starmix(k, attr, base=NULL, diff=TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{k}{only a single value of \eqn{k} is allowed}

\item{attr}{quantitative attribute (see Specifying Vertex attributes and Levels (\code{?nodal_attributes}) for details.)}

\item{base}{deprecated}

\item{diff}{whether a different statistic is created for each value seen in a b1 node. When \code{diff=TRUE},
the default, a different statistic is created for each value and thus the behavior of this term is reminiscent of the
\code{nodemix} term, from which it takes its name; when \code{diff=FALSE} ,
all homophilous k-stars are counted together, though these k-stars are still
categorized according to the value of the central b1 node.}
}
\description{
Mixing matrix for k-stars centered on the second mode of a bipartite network
}
\details{
This term is exactly the same as \code{b1starmix} except that the roles of
b1 and b2 are reversed.
}
\note{
The argument \code{base} is retained for backwards compatibility and may be
removed in a future version. When both \code{base} and \code{levels} are passed,
\code{levels} overrides \code{base}.
