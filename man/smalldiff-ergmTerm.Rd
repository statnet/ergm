\title{Number of ties between actors with similar attribute values}
\usage{
# binary: smalldiff(attr, cutoff)

\item{attr}{quantitative attribute (see Specifying Vertex attributes and Levels (\code{?nodal_attributes}) for details.)}

\item{maximum}{difference in attribute values for ties to be considered}

\description{
Number of ties between actors with similar (but not necessarily identical) attribute values
}
\details{
This term adds one statistic, having as its
value the number of edges in the network for which the incident
actors' attribute values differ less than \code{cutoff} ; that is,
number of edges between \code{i} to \code{j} such that
\code{abs(attr[i]-attr[j])<cutoff} .
