\usage{
# binary: b1nodematch(attr, diff=FALSE, keep=NULL, alpha=1, beta=1, byb2attr=NULL,
#                     levels=NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{attr}{quantitative attribute (see Specifying Vertex attributes and Levels (\code{?nodal_attributes}) for details.)}

\item{diff}{by default, one statistic will be added to the model. If \code{diff} is set to \code{TRUE}, one statistic will be added for each unique value of the \code{attr} attribute}

\item{keep}{deprecated}

\item{alpha, beta}{optional discount parameters both of which take values from \verb{[0, 1]}, only one should be
set at one time}

\item{byb2attr}{specifies a
second mode categorical attribute. Setting this argument
will separate the orginal statistics based on the values of the set second mode attribute---
i.e. for example, if \code{diff} is \code{FALSE} , then the sum of all the statistics for
each level of this second-mode attribute will be equal to the original \code{b1nodematch}
statistic where \code{byb2attr} set to \code{NULL} .}

\item{levels}{select a subset of \code{attr} values to include. (See Specifying Vertex
attributes and Levels (\code{\link[=nodal_attributes]{?nodal_attributes}}) for details.)}

\description{
Nodal attribute-based homophily effect for the first mode in a bipartite (aka two-mode) network
}
\details{
This term is introduced
in Bomiriya et al (2014). With the default \code{alpha} and \code{beta} values, this term will
simply be a homophily based two-star statistic. This term adds one statistic to the model
unless \code{diff} is set to \code{TRUE} , in which case the term adds multiple network
statistics to the model, one for each of (a subset of) the unique values of the \code{attr}
attribute.

If an \code{alpha}
discount parameter is used, each of these statistics gives the sum of
the number of common second-mode nodes raised to the power \code{alpha} for each pair of
first-mode nodes with that attribute. If a \code{beta} discount parameter is used, each
of these statistics gives half the sum of the number of two-paths with two first-mode nodes
with that attribute as the two ends of the two path raised to the power \code{beta} for each
edge in the network.
}
\note{
This term can only be used with undirected bipartite networks.

The argument \code{keep} is retained for backwards compatibility and may be
removed in a future version. When both \code{keep} and \code{levels} are passed,
\code{levels} overrides \code{keep}.
