\title{Degree for the second mode in a bipartite network}
\usage{
# binary: b2degree(d, by=NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{d}{a vector of distinct integers}

\item{by}{this optional term specifies
a vertex attribute (see Specifying Vertex attributes and Levels (\code{?nodal_attributes}) for details). If this is specified
then each node's degree is tabulated only with other nodes having the same
value of the \code{by} attribute.}
}
\description{
Degree for the second mode in a bipartite (aka two-mode) network
}
\details{
This term adds one network statistic to the model for
each element in \code{d} ; the \eqn{i} th such statistic equals the number of
nodes of degree \code{d[i]} in the second mode of a bipartite network, i.e.
with exactly \code{d[i]} edges. The second mode of a bipartite network
object is sometimes known as the "event" mode.
}
\note{
This term can only be used with undirected bipartite networks.
