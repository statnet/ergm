\itemize{
\item \code{coef(ergm)}: extracts the \code{ergm} parameters; may be
removed in favour of the default method once the number of \code{ergm}
objects with \verb{$coef} elements in the wild is sufficiently low.

\item \code{$}: accesses elements of \code{ergm} objects;
needed for backwards compatibility when components get renamed.
