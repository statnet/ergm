\arguments{
\item{nsim}{Number of networks to be randomly drawn using Markov chain Monte
Carlo.  This sample of networks provides the basis for comparing the model
to the observed network.}

\item{MCMC.burnin}{Number of proposals before any MCMC sampling is done. It
typically is set to a fairly large number.}

\item{MCMC.interval}{Number of proposals between sampled statistics.}

\item{MCMC.prop.weights}{Specifies the proposal distribution used in the
MCMC Metropolis-Hastings algorithm.  Possible choices are \code{"TNT"} or
\code{"random"}; the \code{"default"} is one of these two, depending on the
constraints in place (as defined by the \code{constraints} argument of the
\code{\link{ergm}} function), though not all weights may be used with all
constraints.  The \code{TNT} (tie / no tie) option puts roughly equal weight
on selecting a dyad with or without a tie as a candidate for toggling,
whereas the \code{random} option puts equal weight on all possible dyads,
though the interpretation of \code{random} may change according to the
constraints in place.  When no constraints are in place, the default is TNT,
which appears to improve Markov chain mixing particularly for networks with
a low edge density, as is typical of many realistic social networks.}

\item{MCMC.prop.args}{An alternative, direct way of specifying additional
arguments to proposal.}

\item{MCMC.init.maxedges}{Maximum number of edges expected in network.}

\item{MCMC.packagenames}{Names of packages in which to look for change
statistic functions in addition to those autodetected. This argument should
not be needed outside of very strange setups.}

\item{MCMC.runtime.traceplot}{Logical: If TRUE, plot traceplots of the MCMC
sample after every MCMC MLE iteration.}

\item{network.output}{R class with which to output networks. The options are
"network" (default) and "edgelist.compressed" (which saves space but only
supports networks without vertex attributes)}

\item{seed}{Seed value (integer) for the random number generator.  See
\code{\link[base]{set.seed}}.}

\item{parallel}{Number of threads in which to run the sampling. Defaults to
0 (no parallelism). See the entry on [parallel processing][ergm-parallel]
for details and troubleshooting.}

\item{parallel.type}{API to use for parallel processing. Supported values
are \code{"MPI"} and \code{"PSOCK"}. Defaults to using the \code{parallel}
package with PSOCK clusters. See \code{\link{ergm-parallel}}}

\item{parallel.version.check}{Logical: If TRUE, check that the version of
\code{\link[=ergm-package]{ergm}} running on the slave nodes is the same as
that running on the master node.}

\description{
Auxiliary function as user interface for fine-tuning ERGM Goodness-of-Fit
Evaluation.

The \code{control.gof.ergm} version is intended to be used
with \code{\link[=gof.ergm]{gof.ergm()}} specifically and will "inherit" as many control
parameters from \code{\link{ergm}} fit as possible().
}
\details{
This function is only used within a call to the \code{\link{gof}} function.
See the \code{usage} section in \code{\link{gof}} for details.

\code{\link{gof}}. The \code{\link{control.simulate}} function
performs a similar function for \code{\link{simulate.ergm}};
\code{\link{control.ergm}} performs a similar function for
\code{\link{ergm}}.
