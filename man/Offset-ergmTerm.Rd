\title{Terms with fixed coefficients}
\usage{
# binary: Offset(formula, coef, which)
}
\arguments{
\item{formula}{formula to be evaluated}

\item{coef}{coefficients to the formula}

\item{which}{used to specify which of the parameters in the formula are fixed. It can be a logical vector (recycled as needed), a numeric vector of indices of parameters to be fixed, or a character vector of parameter names.}
}
\description{
Terms with fixed coefficients
}
\details{
This operator is analogous to the \code{offset()} wrapper, but the
coefficients are specified within the term and the curved ERGM
mechanism is used internally.
