\title{Geometrically weighted dyadwise shared partner distribution}
\usage{
# binary: dgwdsp(decay, fixed=FALSE, cutoff=30, type="OTP")
}
\arguments{
\item{decay}{Decay parameter to the model. This parameter was called \code{alpha} prior to \verb{ergm 3.7} and should be non-negative.}

\item{fixed}{optional argument indicating
whether the \code{decay} parameter is fixed at the given value, or is to be fit as a curved
exponential-family model (see Hunter and Handcock, 2006). The
default is \code{FALSE} , which means the scale parameter is not
fixed and thus the model is a CEF model.}

\item{cutoff}{This optional argument sets the number of underlying DSP terms
to use in computing the statistics when \code{fixed=FALSE}, in order to reduce
the computational burden.  Its default value can also be controlled by the
\code{gw.cutoff} term option control parameter. (See \code{?control.ergm}.)}

\item{type}{one of \code{c("OTP", "ITP", "RTP", "OSP", "ISP")}}
}
\description{
Geometrically weighted dyadwise shared partner distribution
}
\details{
This term adds one network statistic to the model equal to the geometrically weighted dyadwise shared partner distribution with decay parameter \code{decay} parameter.
}
\note{
While there is only one shared partner configuration in the undirected
case, nine distinct configurations are possible for directed graphs, selected
using the \code{type} argument. Currently, terms may be defined with respect to
five of these configurations; they are defined here as follows (using
terminology from Butts (2008) and the \code{relevent} package):
\itemize{
\item Outgoing Two-path (\code{"OTP"}): vertex \eqn{k} is an OTP shared partner of ordered
pair \eqn{(i,j)} iff \eqn{i \to k \to j}{i->k->j}. Also known as "transitive
shared partner".
\item Incoming Two-path (\code{"ITP"}): vertex \eqn{k} is an ITP shared partner of ordered
pair \eqn{(i,j)} iff \eqn{j \to k \to i}{j->k->i}. Also known as "cyclical shared
partner"
\item Reciprocated Two-path (\code{"RTP"}): vertex \eqn{k} is an RTP shared partner of ordered
pair \eqn{(i,j)} iff \eqn{i \leftrightarrow k \leftrightarrow j}{i<->k<->j}.
\item Outgoing Shared Partner (\code{"OSP"}): vertex \eqn{k} is an OSP shared partner of
ordered pair \eqn{(i,j)} iff \eqn{i \to k, j \to k}{i->k, j->k}.
\item Incoming Shared Partner (\code{"ISP"}): vertex \eqn{k} is an ISP shared partner of ordered
pair \eqn{(i,j)} iff \eqn{k \to i, k \to j}{k->i, k->j}.
By default, outgoing two-paths (\code{"OTP"}) are calculated. Note that Robins et al. (2009)
define closely related statistics to several of the above, using slightly different terminology.
}

The GWDSP statistic is equal to the sum of GWNSP plus GWESP.
