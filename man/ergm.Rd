\arguments{
\item{formula}{{An \R \code{\link{formula}} object, of the form
\code{y ~ <model terms>},
where \code{y} is a \code{\link[network]{network}} object or a matrix that can be
coerced to a \code{\link[network]{network}}  object.  For the details on the possible
\code{<model terms>}, see \code{\link{ergm-terms}} and Morris, Handcock and
Hunter (2008) for binary ERGM terms and
Krivitsky (2012) for valued ERGM
terms (terms for weighted edges).  To create a
\code{\link[network]{network}} object in \R, use the \code{network()} function,
then add nodal attributes to it using the \code{\%v\%}
operator if necessary. Enclosing a model term in \code{offset()}
fixes its value to one specified in \code{offset.coef}.
}}

\item{response}{Name of the edge attribute whose value is to be
modeled in the valued ERGM framework. Defaults to \code{NULL} for
simple presence or absence, modeled via a binary ERGM.}

\item{reference}{A one-sided formula specifying
the reference measure (\eqn{h(y)}) to be used.
See help for \link[=ergm-references]{ERGM reference measures} implemented in the
\strong{\link[=ergm-package]{ergm}} package.}

\item{constraints}{{A formula specifying one or more constraints
on the support of the distribution of the networks being modeled,
using syntax similar to the \code{formula} argument, on the
right-hand side. Multiple constraints
may be given, separated by \dQuote{+} and \dQuote{-} operators. (See
\link[=ergm-constraints]{ERGM constraints} for the explanation of
their semantics.)
Together with the model terms in the formula and the reference measure, the constraints
define the distribution of networks being modeled.

It is also possible to specify a proposal function directly
either by passing a string with the function's name (in which case,
arguments to the proposal should be specified through the
\code{prop.args} argument to \code{\link{control.ergm}}) or by
giving it on the LHS of the constraints formula, in which case it
will override the one chosen automatically.

The default is \code{~.}, for an unconstrained model.

See the \link[=ergm-constraints]{ERGM constraints} documentation for
the constraints implemented in the \strong{\link[=ergm-package]{ergm}}
package. Other packages may add their own constraints.

Note that not all possible combinations of constraints and reference
measures are supported. However, for relatively simple constraints
(i.e., those that simply permit or forbid specific dyads or sets of
dyads from changing), arbitrary combinations should be possible.
}}

\item{offset.coef}{{A vector of coefficients for the offset terms.}}

\item{target.stats}{{vector of "observed network statistics,"
if these statistics are for some reason different than the
actual statistics of the network on the left-hand side of
\code{formula}.
Equivalently, this vector is the mean-value parameter values for the
model.  If this is given, the algorithm finds the natural
parameter values corresponding to these mean-value parameters.
If \code{NULL}, the mean-value parameters used are the observed
statistics of the network in the formula.
}}

\item{eval.loglik}{{Logical:  For dyad-dependent models, if TRUE, use bridge
sampling to evaluate the log-likelihoood associated with the
fit. Has no effect for dyad-independent models.
Since bridge sampling takes additional time, setting to FALSE may
speed performance if likelihood values (and likelihood-based
values like AIC and BIC) are not needed. Can be set globally via \code{option(ergm.eval.loglik=...)}, which is set to \code{TRUE} when the package is loaded. (See \code{\link[=ergm-options]{options?ergm}}.)
}}

\item{estimate}{{If "MPLE," then the maximum pseudolikelihood estimator
is returned.  If "MLE" (the default), then an approximate maximum likelihood
estimator is returned.  For certain models, the MPLE and MLE are equivalent,
in which case this argument is ignored.  (To force MCMC-based approximate
likelihood calculation even when the MLE and MPLE are the same, see the
\code{force.main} argument of \code{\link{control.ergm}}. If "CD" (\emph{EXPERIMENTAL}),
the Monte-Carlo contrastive divergence estimate is returned. )
}}

\item{control}{A list of control parameters for algorithm
tuning. Constructed using \code{\link{control.ergm}}.}

\item{verbose}{A \code{logical} or an integer: if this is
\code{TRUE}/\code{1}, the program will print out additional
information about the progress of estimation and
simulation. Higher values produce more verbosity.}

\item{\dots}{Additional
arguments, to be passed to lower-level functions.}

\item{basis}{a value (usually a \code{\link{network}}) to override the LHS of the formula.}

\item{object}{{an \code{ergm} object.}}

\item{x, digits}{See \code{\link[=print]{print()}}.

Automatically called when an object of class \code{\link{ergm}} is printed.
Currently, summarizes the size of the MCMC sample, the \eqn{\theta}
vector governing the selection of the sample, and the Monte Carlo MLE. The optional \code{digits} argument specifies the significant digits for coefficients}

\item{sources}{For the \code{vcov} method, specify whether to return
the covariance matrix from the ERGM model, the estimation
process, or both combined.}
}
\value{
\code{\link{ergm}} returns an object of class \code{\link{ergm}} that is a list
consisting of the following elements:
\item{coef}{The Monte Carlo maximum likelihood estimate
of \eqn{\theta}, the vector of coefficients for the model
parameters.}
\item{sample}{The \eqn{n\times p} matrix of network statistics,
where \eqn{n} is the
sample size and \eqn{p} is the number of network statistics specified in the
model, generated by the last iteration of the MCMC-based likelihood maximization routine. These statistics are centered with respect to the observed statistics or \code{target.stats}, unless missing data MLE is used.}
\item{sample.obs}{As \code{sample}, but for the constrained sample.}
\item{iterations}{The number of Newton-Raphson iterations required
before convergence.}
\item{MCMCtheta}{The value of \eqn{\theta} used to produce the Markov chain
Monte Carlo sample.  As long as the Markov chain mixes sufficiently
well, \code{sample} is roughly a random sample from the distribution
of network statistics specified by the model with the parameter equal
to \code{MCMCtheta}.  If \code{estimate="MPLE"} then
\code{MCMCtheta} equals the MPLE.}
\item{loglikelihood}{The approximate change in log-likelihood
in the last iteration.
The value is only approximate because it is estimated based
on the MCMC random sample.}
\item{gradient}{The value of the gradient vector of the approximated
loglikelihood function, evaluated at the maximizer.  This vector
should be very close to zero.}
\item{covar}{Approximate covariance matrix for the MLE, based on the inverse
Hessian of the approximated loglikelihood evaluated at the maximizer.}
\item{failure}{Logical:  Did the MCMC estimation fail?}
\item{network}{Network passed on the left-hand side of \code{formula}. If \code{target.stats} are passed, it is replaced by the network returned by \code{\link[=san]{san()}}.}
\item{newnetworks}{A list of the final networks at the end of the MCMC
simulation, one for each thread.}
\item{newnetwork}{The first (possibly only) element of \code{netwonetworks}.}

\item{est.cov}{The covariance matrix of the model statistics in the final MCMC sample.}
\item{coef.hist, steplen.hist, stats.hist, stats.obs.hist}{
For the MCMLE method, the history of coefficients, Hummel step lengths, and average model statistics for each iteration..
}
\item{control}{The control list passed to the call.}
\item{etamap}{The set of functions mapping the true parameter theta
to the canonical parameter eta (irrelevant except in a curved exponential
family model)}

\item{target.stats}{The target.stats used during estimation (passed through from the Arguments)}
\item{target.esteq}{Used for curved models to preserve the target mean values of the curved terms. It is identical to target.stats for non-curved models.}
\item{constrained}{The list of constraints implied by the constraints used by original \code{ergm} call}
\item{constraints}{Constraints used during estimation (passed through from the Arguments)}
\item{reference}{The reference measure used during estimation (passed through from the Arguments)}
\item{estimate}{The estimation method used (passed through from the Arguments).}
\item{offset}{vector of logical telling which model parameters are to be set
at a fixed value (i.e., not estimated).}

\item{drop}{If \code{\link[=control.ergm]{control$drop}=TRUE}, a numeric vector indicating which terms were dropped due to to extreme values of the
corresponding statistics on the observed network, and how:
\describe{
\item{\code{0}}{The term was not dropped.}
\item{\code{-1}}{The term was at its minimum and the coefficient was fixed at
\code{-Inf}.}
\item{\code{+1}}{The term was at its maximum and the coefficient was fixed at
\code{+Inf}.}
}
}

\item{estimable}{A logical vector indicating which terms could not be
estimated due to a \code{constraints} constraint fixing that term at a
constant value.
}

\item{null.lik}{Log-likelihood of the null model. Valid only for
unconstrained models.}
\item{mle.lik}{The approximate log-likelihood for the MLE.
The value is only approximate because it is estimated based
on the MCMC random sample.}
}
\description{
\code{\link{ergm}} is used to fit exponential-family random graph
models (ERGMs), in which
the probability of a given network, \eqn{y}, on a set of nodes is
\eqn{h(y) \exp\{\eta(\theta) \cdot
g(y)\}/c(\theta)}, where
\eqn{h(y)} is the reference measure (usually \eqn{h(y)=1}),
\eqn{g(y)} is a vector of network statistics for \eqn{y},
\eqn{\eta(\theta)} is a natural parameter vector of the same
length (with \eqn{\eta(\theta)=\theta} for most terms), and \eqn{c(\theta)} is the
normalizing constant for the distribution.
\code{\link{ergm}} can return a maximum pseudo-likelihood
estimate, an approximate maximum likelihood estimate based on a Monte
Carlo scheme, or an approximate contrastive divergence estimate based
on a similar scheme.

\section{Notes on model specification}{

Although each of the statistics in a given model is a summary
statistic for the entire network, it is rarely necessary to
calculate statistics for an entire network
in a proposed Metropolis-Hastings step.
Thus, for example, if the triangle term is included in the model,
a census of all triangles in the observed network is never
taken; instead, only the change in the number of triangles
is recorded for each edge toggle.

In the implementation of \code{\link{ergm}}, the model is initialized
in \R, then all the model information is passed to a C program
that generates the sample of network statistics using MCMC.
This sample is then returned to \R, which implements a
simple Newton-Raphson algorithm to approximate the MLE.
An alternative style of maximum likelihood estimation is to use a stochastic
approximation algorithm. This can be chosen with the
\code{control.ergm(style="Robbins-Monro")} option.

The mechanism for proposing new networks for the MCMC sampling
scheme, which is a Metropolis-Hastings algorithm, depends on
two things:  The \code{constraints}, which define the set of possible
networks that could be proposed in a particular Markov chain step,
and the weights placed on these possible steps by the
proposal distribution.  The former may be controlled using the
\code{constraints} argument described above.  The latter may
be controlled using the \code{prop.weights} argument to the
\code{\link{control.ergm}} function.

The package is designed so that the user could conceivably add additional
proposal types.
