\title{Constrain maximum and minimum vertex degree}
\usage{
# bd(attribs, maxout, maxin, minout, minin)
}
\arguments{
\item{attribs}{a matrix of logicals with dimension \verb{(n_nodes, attrcount)} for the attributes on which we are
conditioning, where \code{attrcount} is the number of distinct attributes values to condition on.}

\item{maxout, maxin, minout, minin}{matrices of alter attributes with the same dimension as \code{attribs} when used
in conjunction with \code{attribs}. Otherwise, vectors of integers specifying the relevant limits.
If the vector is of length 1, the limit is applied to all nodes. If an individual entry is \code{NA},
then there is no restriction of that kind is applied.}
