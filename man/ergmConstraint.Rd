\title{Sample Space Constraints for Exponential-Family Random Graph Models}
\description{
This page describes how to specify the constraints on the network sample space (the set of possible networks \eqn{Y}, the set of networks \eqn{y} for which \eqn{h(y)>0}) and sometimes the baseline weights \eqn{h(y)} to functions in the \code{\link[=ergm-package]{ergm}}
package. It also provides an indexed list of the constraints visible to the \CRANpkg{ergm}'s API. Constraints can also be searched via \code{\link{search.ergmConstraints}}, and help for an individual constraint can be obtained with \verb{ergmConstraint?<constraint>} or \code{help("<constraint>-ergmConstraint")}.

\section{Specifying constraints}{

\ERGMspec
Constraints typically affect \eqn{Y}, or, equivalently, set \eqn{h(y)=0} for some \eqn{y}, but some (\dQuote{soft} constraints) set
\eqn{h(y)} to values other than 0 and 1.

A constraints formula is a one- or two-sided formula whose left-hand side is
an optional direct selection of the \code{InitErgmProposal} function and
whose right-hand side is a series of one or more terms separated by
\code{"+"} and \code{"-"} operators, specifying the constraint.

The sample space (over and above the reference distribution) is determined
by iterating over the constraints terms from left to right, each term
updating it as follows:
\itemize{
\item If the constraint introduces complex
dependence structure (e.g., constrains degree or number of edges in the
network), then this constraint always restricts the sample space. It may
only have a \code{"+"} sign.
\item If the constraint only restricts the set of dyads that may vary in the
sample space (e.g., block-diagonal structure or fixing specific dyads at
specific values) and has a \code{"+"} sign, the set of dyads that may
vary is restricted to those that may vary according to this constraint
\emph{and} all the constraints to date.
\item If the constraint only restricts the set of dyads that may vary in the
sample space but has a \code{"-"} sign, the set of dyads that may
vary is expanded to those that may vary according to this constraint
\emph{or} all the constraints up to date.
}

For example, a constraints formula \code{~a-b+c-d} with all constraints
dyadic will allow dyads permitted by either \code{a} or \code{b} but only if they are
also permitted by \code{c}; as well as all dyads permitted by \code{d}. If \code{A}, \code{B},
\code{C}, and \code{D} were logical matrices, the matrix of variable dyads would be
equal to \code{((A|B)&C)|D}.

Terms with a positive sign can be viewed as "adding" a constraint
while those with a negative sign can be viewed as "relaxing" a constraint.

The constraints formula can also contain a \code{.}. If present,
\code{\link{\%ergmlhs\%}} attributes \code{constraints} and \code{constraints.obs} will
be substituted in its place.
