\arguments{
\item{nodes}{By default, \code{nodes=-1} means that the statistic for the
first node (in the second bipartition) will be omitted, but this argument may be changed to control
which statistics are included. The \code{nodes} argument is interpreted using the new UI for level specification
(see Specifying Vertex Attributes and Levels (\code{?nodal_attributes}) for details), where both the attribute and the sorted
unique values are the vector of vertex indices \code{(nb1 + 1):n} , where
\code{nb1} is the size of the first bipartition and \code{n} is the total number of nodes in the network. Thus \code{nodes=120} will include only the statistic
for the 120th node in the second biparition, while \code{nodes=I(120)} will include only the statistic for the 120th node in the entire network.}

\item{form}{character how to aggregate tie values in a valued ERGM}
}
\description{
This term adds one network statistic for each node in the second bipartition, equal to the number of
ties of that node. For directed networks, see \code{sender} and
\code{receiver} . For unipartite networks, see \code{sociality} .
}
\note{
This term can only be used with undirected bipartite networks.
