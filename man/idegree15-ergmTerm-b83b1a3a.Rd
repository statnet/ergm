\title{In-degree to the 3/2 power}
\usage{
# binary: idegree1.5
}
\description{
This term adds one network statistic to the model equaling the sum
over the actors of each actor's indegree taken to the 3/2 power
(or, equivalently, multiplied by its square root). This term is
analogous to the term of \insertCite{SnVa10i;textual}{ergm}, equation (12). This
term can only be used with directed networks.
