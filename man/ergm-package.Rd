\title{Fit, Simulate and Diagnose Exponential-Family Models for Networks}
\description{
\code{\link[=ergm-package]{ergm}} is a collection of functions to plot, fit,
diagnose, and simulate from exponential-family random graph models (ERGMs).
For a list of functions type: \code{help(package='ergm')}
}
\details{
For a complete list of the functions, use \code{library(help="ergm")} or
read the rest of the manual. For a simple demonstration, use
\code{demo(packages="ergm")}.

When publishing results obtained using this package, please cite the
original authors as described in \code{citation(package="ergm")}.

All programs derived from this package must cite it.

Recent advances in the statistical modeling of random networks have had an
impact on the empirical study of social networks. Statistical exponential
family models (Strauss and Ikeda 1990) are a generalization of the Markov
random network models introduced by Frank and Strauss (1986), which in turn
derived from developments in spatial statistics (Besag, 1974). These models
recognize the complex dependencies within relational data structures.  To
date, the use of stochastic network models for networks has been limited by
three interrelated factors: the complexity of realistic models, the lack of
simulation tools for inference and validation, and a poor understanding of
the inferential properties of nontrivial models.

This manual introduces software tools for the representation, visualization,
and analysis of network data that address each of these previous
shortcomings.  The package relies on the \code{\link[network]{network}}
package which allows networks to be represented in . The
\code{\link[=ergm-package]{ergm}} package implements maximum likelihood
estimates of ERGMs to be calculated using Markov Chain Monte Carlo (via
\code{\link{ergm}}). The package also provides tools for simulating networks
(via \code{\link{simulate.ergm}}) and assessing model goodness-of-fit (see
\code{\link{mcmc.diagnostics}} and \code{\link{gof.ergm}}).

A number of Statnet Project packages extend and enhance
\code{\link[=ergm-package]{ergm}}. These include
\code{\link[tergm:tergm-package]{tergm}} (Temporal ERGM), which provides
extensions for modeling evolution of networks over time;
\code{\link[ergm.count:ergm.count-package]{ergm.count}}, which facilitates
exponential family modeling for networks whose dyadic measurements are
counts; and
\code{\link[ergm.userterms:ergm.userterms-package]{ergm.userterms}}, which
allows users to implement their own ERGM terms.

For detailed information on how to download and install the software, go to

tutorial, support newsgroup, references and links to further resources are
provided there.
