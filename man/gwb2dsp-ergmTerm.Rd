\title{Geometrically weighted dyadwise shared partner distribution for dyads in the second bipartition}
\usage{
# binary: gwb2dsp(decay=0, fixed=FALSE, cutoff=30)
}
\arguments{
\item{decay}{decay parmeter for the model}

\item{fixed}{optional argument indicating
whether the \code{decay} parameter is fixed at the given value, or is to be fit as a curved
exponential-family model (see Hunter and Handcock, 2006). The
default is \code{FALSE} , which means the scale parameter is not
fixed and thus the model is a CEF model.}

\item{cutoff}{This optional argument sets the number of underlying b2dsp terms
to use in computing the statistics when \code{fixed=FALSE}, in order to reduce
the computational burden.  Its default value can also be controlled by the
\code{gw.cutoff} term option control parameter. (See \code{?control.ergm}.)}

\description{
Geometrically weighted dyadwise shared partner distribution for dyads in the second bipartition
}
\details{
This term adds one network statistic to the model equal to the geometrically
weighted dyadwise shared partner distribution for dyads in the second bipartition with decay parameter
\code{decay} parameter, which should be non-negative. This term can only be used with bipartite networks.
