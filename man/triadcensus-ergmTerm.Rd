\description{
For a directed network, this term adds one network statistic for each of
an arbitrary subset of the 16 possible types of triads categorized by
Davis and Leinhardt (1972) as \verb{003, 012, 102, 021D, 021U, 021C, 111D, } \verb{	111U, 030T, 030C, 201, 120D, 120U, 120C, 210,} and \code{300} . Note that at
least one category should be dropped; otherwise a linear dependency will
exist among the 16 statistics, since they must sum to the total number of
three-node sets. By default, the category \code{003} , which is the category
of completely empty three-node sets, is dropped. This is considered category
zero, and the others are numbered 1 through 15 in the order given above. Each statistic is the count of the corresponding triad
type in the network. For details on the 16 types, see \code{?triad.classify}
in the \code{sna} package, on which this code is based. For an undirected
network, the triad census is over the four types defined by the number of
ties (i.e., 0, 1, 2, and 3).
