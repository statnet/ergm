\title{Transitive triads}
\usage{
# binary: transitive
}
\description{
This term adds one statistic to the model, equal to the number of triads in
the network that are transitive. The transitive triads are those of type
\verb{120D} , \verb{030T} , \verb{120U} , or \code{300} in the categorization
of Davis and Leinhardt (1972). For details on the 16 possible triad types,
see \code{?triad.classify} in the \code{sna} package.
Note the distinction from the \code{ttriple} term. This term can only be
used with directed networks.
