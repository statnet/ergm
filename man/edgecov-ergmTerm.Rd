\usage{
# binary: edgecov(x, attrname=NULL)

# valued: edgecov(x, attrname=NULL, form="sum")
}
\arguments{
\item{x, attrname}{either a square matrix of covariates, one for each possible
edge in the network, the name of a network attribute of covariates,
or a network; if the latter, optional argument \code{attrname} provides
the name of the quantitative edge attribute to use for covariate values
(in this case, missing edges in \code{x} are assigned a covariate value
of zero).}

\item{form}{character how to aggregate tie values in a valued ERGM}
}
\description{
Edge covariate
}
\details{
This term adds one statistic to the model, equal to the sum
of the covariate values for each edge appearing in the network. The
\code{edgecov} term applies to both directed and undirected networks. For
undirected networks the covariates are also assumed to be undirected. The
\code{edgecov} and \code{dyadcov} terms are equivalent for undirected
networks.
