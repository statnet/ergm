\title{Minimum degree for the second mode in a bipartite network}
\usage{
# binary: b2mindegree(d)
}
\arguments{
\item{d}{a vector of distinct integers}
}
\description{
This term adds one network statistic to the model for
each element in \code{d} ; the \eqn{i} th such statistic equals the number of
nodes in the second mode of a bipartite network with at least degree \code{d[i]} .
The second mode of a bipartite network object is sometimes known as the "event" mode.
}
\note{
This term can only be used with undirected bipartite networks.
