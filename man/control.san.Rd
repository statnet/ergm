\arguments{
\item{SAN.maxit}{Number of temperature levels to use.}

\item{SAN.tau}{Tuning parameter, specifying the temperature of the
process during the \emph{penultimate} iteration. (During the last
iteration, the temperature is set to 0, resulting in a greedy
search, and during the previous iterations, the temperature is
set to \verb{SAN.tau*(iterations left after this one)}.}

\item{SAN.invcov}{Initial inverse covariance matrix used to
calculate Mahalanobis distance in determining how far a proposed
MCMC move is from the \code{target.stats} vector.  If \code{NULL},
initially set to the identity matrix, then during subsequent runs
estimated empirically.}

\item{SAN.invcov.diag}{Whether to only use the diagonal of the
covariance matrix. It seems to work better in practice.}

\item{SAN.nsteps.alloc}{Either a numeric vector or a function of
the number of runs giving a sequence of relative lengths of
simulated annealing runs.}

\item{SAN.nsteps}{Number of MCMC proposals for all the annealing runs combined.}

\item{SAN.samplesize}{Number of realisations' statistics to obtain for tuning purposes.}

\item{SAN.init.maxedges}{Maximum number of edges expected in network.}

\item{SAN.max.maxedges}{Hard upper bound on the number of edges in the network.}

\item{SAN.prop.weights}{Specifies the proposal
distribution used in the SAN Metropolis-Hastings algorithm.  Possible
choices depending on selected \code{reference} and \code{constraints}
arguments of the \code{\link[=ergm]{ergm()}} function, but often include \code{"TNT"}
and \code{"random"}, and the \code{"default"} is to use the one with the
highest priority available.

The \code{TNT} (tie / no tie) option puts roughly equal weight on selecting
a dyad with or without a tie as a candidate for toggling, whereas the
\code{random} option puts equal weight on all possible dyads, though the
interpretation of \code{random} may change according to the constraints in
place.  When no constraints are in place, the default is TNT, which appears
to improve Markov chain mixing particularly for networks with a low edge
density, as is typical of many realistic social networks.}

\item{SAN.prop.args}{An alternative, direct way of
specifying additional arguments to proposal.}

\item{SAN.packagenames}{Names of packages in which to look for change
statistic functions in addition to those autodetected. This argument should
not be needed outside of very strange setups.}

\item{SAN.ignore.finite.offsets}{Whether SAN should ignore (treat as 0) finite offsets.}

\item{term.options}{A list of additional arguments to be passed to term initializers. See \code{\link[=term.options]{? term.options}}.}

\item{seed}{Seed value (integer) for the random number generator.  See
\code{\link[base]{set.seed}}.}

\item{parallel}{Number of threads in which to run the sampling. Defaults to
0 (no parallelism). See the entry on \link[=ergm-parallel]{parallel processing}
for details and troubleshooting.}

\item{parallel.type}{API to use for parallel processing. Supported values
are \code{"MPI"} and \code{"PSOCK"}. Defaults to using the \code{parallel}
package with PSOCK clusters. See \code{\link{ergm-parallel}}}

\item{parallel.version.check}{Logical: If TRUE, check that the version of
\code{\link[=ergm-package]{ergm}} running on the slave nodes is the same as
that running on the master node.}
