\description{
Directed non-edgewise shared partners
}
\details{
This term adds one network statistic to the model for each element in \code{d} where the \eqn{i} th such statistic equals the number of non-edges in the network with exactly \code{d[i]} shared partners.
}
\note{
This term can only be used with directed networks.

While there is only one shared partner configuration in the undirected
case, nine distinct configurations are possible for directed graphs, selected
using the \code{type} argument. Currently, terms may be defined with respect to
five of these configurations; they are defined here as follows (using
terminology from Butts (2008) and the \code{relevent} package):
\itemize{
\item Outgoing Two-path (\code{"OTP"}): vertex \eqn{k} is an OTP shared partner of ordered
pair \eqn{(i,j)} iff \eqn{i \to k \to j}{i->k->j}. Also known as "transitive
shared partner".
\item Incoming Two-path (\code{"ITP"}): vertex \eqn{k} is an ITP shared partner of ordered
pair \eqn{(i,j)} iff \eqn{j \to k \to i}{j->k->i}. Also known as "cyclical shared
partner"
\item Reciprocated Two-path (\code{"RTP"}): vertex \eqn{k} is an RTP shared partner of ordered
pair \eqn{(i,j)} iff \eqn{i \leftrightarrow k \leftrightarrow j}{i<->k<->j}.
\item Outgoing Shared Partner (\code{"OSP"}): vertex \eqn{k} is an OSP shared partner of
ordered pair \eqn{(i,j)} iff \eqn{i \to k, j \to k}{i->k, j->k}.
\item Incoming Shared Partner (\code{"ISP"}): vertex \eqn{k} is an ISP shared partner of ordered
pair \eqn{(i,j)} iff \eqn{k \to i, k \to j}{k->i, k->j}.
By default, outgoing two-paths (\code{"OTP"}) are calculated. Note that Robins et al. (2009)
define closely related statistics to several of the above, using slightly different terminology.
