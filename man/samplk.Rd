\description{
Three \code{\link[network:network]{network}} objects containing the "liking" nominations of
Sampson's (1969) monks at the three time points.
}
\details{
Sampson (1969) recorded the social interactions among a group of monks while
he was a resident as an experimenter at the cloister.  During his stay, a
political "crisis in the cloister" resulted in the expulsion of four
monks-- namely, the three "outcasts," Brothers Elias, Simplicius, Basil, and
the leader of the "young Turks," Brother Gregory.  Not long after Brother
Gregory departed, all but one of the "young Turks" left voluntarily:
Brothers John Bosco, Albert, Boniface, Hugh, and Mark.  Then, all three of
the "waverers" also left: First, Brothers Amand and Victor, then later
Brother Romuald.  Eventually, Brother Peter and Brother Winfrid also left,
leaving only four of the original group.

Of particular interest are the data on positive affect relations
("liking," using the terminology later adopted by White et al. (1976)), in
which each monk was asked if he had positive relations to each of the other
monks. Each monk ranked only his top three choices (or four, in the case of
ties) on "liking".  Here, we consider a directed edge from monk A to monk
B to exist if A nominated B among these top choices.

The data were gathered at three times to capture changes in group sentiment
over time. They represent three time points in the period during which a new
cohort had entered the monastery near the end of the study but before the
major conflict began.  These three time points are labeled T2, T3, and T4 in
Tables D5 through D16 in the appendices of Sampson's 1969 dissertation.  and
the corresponding network data sets are named \code{samplk1},
\code{samplk2}, and \code{samplk3}, respectively.

See also the data set \code{\link{sampson}} containing the time-aggregated
graph \code{samplike}.

\code{samplk3} is a data set of Hoff, Raftery and Handcock (2002).

The data sets are stored as \code{\link[network:network]{network}} objects with
three vertex attributes:

\describe{ \item{group}{Groups of novices as classified by Sampson, that is,
"Loyal", "Outcasts", and "Turks", but with a fourth group called the
"Waverers" by White et al. (1975) that comprises two of the original Loyal
opposition and one of the original Outcasts. See the \code{\link{samplike}}
data set for the original classifications of these three waverers.}
\item{cloisterville}{An indicator of attendance in the minor seminary of
"Cloisterville" before coming to the monastery.} \item{vertex.names}{The
given names of the novices. NB: These names have been corrected as of
\code{ergm} version 3.6.1.} } This data set is standard in the social
network analysis literature, having been modeled by Holland and Leinhardt
(1981), Reitz (1982), Holland, Laskey and Leinhardt (1983), Fienberg, Meyer,
and Wasserman (1981), and Hoff, Raftery, and Handcock (2002), among others.
This is only a small piece of the data collected by Sampson.

This data set was updated for version 2.5 (March 2012) to add the
\code{cloisterville} variable and refine the names. This information is from
de Nooy, Mrvar, and Batagelj (2005). The original vertex names were:
Romul_10, Bonaven_5, Ambrose_9, Berth_6, Peter_4, Louis_11, Victor_8,
Winf_12, John_1, Greg_2, Hugh_14, Boni_15, Mark_7, Albert_16, Amand_13,
Basil_3, Elias_17, Simp_18. The numbers indicate the ordering used in the
original dissertation of Sampson (1969).

\section{Mislabeling in Versions Prior to 3.6.1}{
 In \code{ergm} versions
3.6.0 and earlier, The adjacency matrices of the \code{\link{samplike}},
\code{\link{samplk1}}, \code{\link{samplk2}}, and \code{\link{samplk3}}
networks reflected the original Sampson (1969) ordering of the names even
though the vertex labels used the name order of de Nooy, Mrvar, and Batagelj
(2005). That is, in \code{ergm} version 3.6.0 and earlier, the vertices were
mislabeled. The correct order is the same one given in Tables D5, D9, and
D13 of Sampson (1969): John Bosco, Gregory, Basil, Peter, Bonaventure,
Berthold, Mark, Victor, Ambrose, Romauld (Sampson uses both spellings
"Romauld" and "Ramauld" in the dissertation), Louis, Winfrid, Amand, Hugh,
Boniface, Albert, Elias, Simplicius. By contrast, the order given in
\code{ergm} version 3.6.0 and earlier is: Ramuald, Bonaventure, Ambrose,
Berthold, Peter, Louis, Victor, Winfrid, John Bosco, Gregory, Hugh,
Boniface, Mark, Albert, Amand, Basil, Elias, Simplicius.
