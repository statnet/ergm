\description{
Factor attribute effect for the second mode in a bipartite (aka two-mode) network
}
\details{
This term adds multiple network statistics to the model, one for each of (a subset of) the
unique values of the \code{attr} attribute. Each of these statistics
gives the number of times a node with that attribute in the second mode of
the network appears in an edge. The second mode of a bipartite network
object is sometimes known as the "event" mode.
}
\note{
To include all attribute values is usually not a good idea, because
the sum of all such statistics equals the number of edges and hence a linear
dependency would arise in any model also including \code{edges}. The default,
\code{levels=-1}, is therefore to omit the first (in lexicographic order)
attribute level. To include all levels, pass either \code{levels=TRUE}
(i.e., keep all levels) or \code{levels=NULL} (i.e., do not filter levels).

The argument \code{base} is retained for backwards compatibility and may be
removed in a future version. When both \code{base} and \code{levels} are passed,
\code{levels} overrides \code{base}.

This term can only be used with undirected bipartite networks.
