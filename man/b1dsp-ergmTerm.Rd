\item{d}{a vector of distinct integers.}

\description{
Dyadwise shared partners for dyads in the first bipartition
}
\details{
This term adds one
network statistic to the model for each element in \code{d} ; the \eqn{i}th
such statistic equals the number of dyads in the first bipartition with exactly
\code{d[i]} shared partners. (Those shared partners, of course, must be members
of the second bipartition.) This term can only be used with bipartite networks.
