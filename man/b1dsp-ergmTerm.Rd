\title{Dyadwise shared partners for dyads in the first bipartition}
\usage{
# binary: b1dsp(d)
}
\arguments{
\item{d}{a vector of distinct integers.}
}
\description{
This term adds one
network statistic to the model for each element in \code{d} ; the \eqn{i}th
such statistic equals the number of dyads in the first bipartition with exactly
\code{d[i]} shared partners. (Those shared partners, of course, must be members
of the second bipartition.) This term can only be used with bipartite networks.
}
\note{
This term takes an additional term option (see
\code{\link[=ergm-options]{options?ergm}}), \code{cache.sp}, controlling whether
the implementation will cache the number of shared partners for
each dyad in the network; this is usually enabled by default.
