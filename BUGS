# Curved term cutoff #

For now, the cutoff= in gw* functions is a hard bound, not adaptive in
any way, even if there exist values above it, to keep things simple
and stable. At this time, if, whether during summarization or during
sampling, a network exceeding this cutoff is encountered, the terms
will silently produce an error.
