# Curved term cutoff #

For now, the cutoff= in gw* functions is a hard bound, not adaptive in 
any way, even if there exist values above it, to keep things simple and 
stable. We may want to improve this later, or at least have the 
initialization functions check if there are values above it.

# Passing curved coefficients as initial values for ergm() #

For a curved model, initial curved parameters cannot be passed in the
theta0 argument and must be embedded in the formula. This prevents
coef() of an ergm fit from being used as initial value for another
ergm run for the same model if the model has curved terms. A function
enformulate.curved() works around this by constructing suitable
inputs, but a more consistent solution is desirable.
