This document provides some examples of how to specify nodal attributes and their transformations in `ergm` terms. For the R help on the topic, see `?nodal_attributes` and for help on implementing terms that use this interface, see `API?nodal_attributes`.

## Extraction and transformation ##

It is sometimes desirable to specify a transformation of a nodal attribute as a covariate in a model term. Most `ergm` terms now support a new Tidyverse-inspired user interface to do so. Arguments using this interface are typically called `attr`, `attrs`, `by`, or
`on` and are interpreted depending on their type:

character string

: Extract the vertex attribute with
      this name.

character vector of length greater than 1

: Extract the vertex attributes and paste them together, separated by
      dots if the term expects categorical attributes and (typically)
      combine into a covariate matrix if it expects quantitative
      attributes.

function

: The function is called on the LHS network, expected to return a
      vector or matrix of appropriate dimension. (Shorter vectors and
      matrix columns will be recycled as needed.)

formula

: Borrowing the interface from \pkg{tidyverse}, the expression on the right hand side of the formula is evaluated in an
      environment of the vertex attributes of the network, expected to
      return a vector or matrix of appropriate dimension. (Shorter
      vectors and matrix columns will be recycled as needed.) Within
      this expression, the network itself accessible as either
      \code{.} or \code{.nw}. For example, in the example below,
      \code{nodecov(~abs(Grade-mean(Grade))/network.size(.))} would
      return the absolute difference of each actor's "Grade" attribute
      from its network-wide mean, divided by the network size.

\code{AsIs} object created by \code{I()}

: Use as is, checking only for correct length and type, with optional
      attribute \code{"name"} indicating the predictor's name.

Any of these arguments may also be wrapped in `COLLAPSE_SMALLEST(attr, n, into)`, a convenience function that will
transform the attribute by collapsing the smallest `n` categories into one, naming it according to the `into` argument. Note that `into` must be of the same type (numeric, character, etc.) as the vertex attribute in
question. This is compatible with using `magrittr`'s pipes for improved readability, i.e., `attr %>% COLLAPSE_SMALLEST(n, into)`. This is illustrated in the next section.

Then, taking `faux.mesa.high` dataset's actor attribute `Grade`, representing the grade of the student, we can evaluate, equivalently, the linear effect of grade on overall activity of an actor:
```{r, node-attr-spec, message=FALSE}
library(ergm)
data(faux.mesa.high)
summary(faux.mesa.high~nodecov("Grade")) # String
summary(faux.mesa.high~nodecov(~Grade)) # Formula
summary(faux.mesa.high~nodecov(function(nw) nw%v%"Grade")) # Function
```
Taking advantage of `nodecov`'s new ability to take matrix-valued arguments, we might also evaluate a polynomial effect of `Grade`:
```{r, node-attr-mat}
# Directly:
summary(faux.mesa.high~nodecov(~cbind(Grade,Grade^2)))
# Using stats::poly() function:
summary(faux.mesa.high~nodecov(~poly(Grade,2)))
```
We can even pass a random nodal covariate. Notice that setting an attribute "name" gives it a label:
```{r, node-attr-rand}
randomcov <- structure(I(rbinom(network.size(faux.mesa.high),1,0.5)), name="random")
summary(faux.mesa.high~nodefactor(I(randomcov)))
```

## Level selection ##

For categorical attributes, to select which levels are of interest
and their ordering, use the argument \code{levels}.  Selection of nodes (from
the appropriate vector of nodal indices) is likewise handled as the
selection of levels, using the argument \code{nodes}.  These arguments are interpreted
as follows:

\code{AsIs} object created by \code{I()}

: Use the given list of levels as is.

numeric or logical vector

: Used for indexing of a list of all possible levels (typically,
\mmnote{this is useful when the attr is not already a factor, right?  should say so}
      unique values of the attribute) in default order (typically
      lexicographic). In particular, `levels=TRUE` will retain all
      levels.
      \mmnote{what does this do when there is an edges term in the model, which will alias a factor level?}
      \pknote{It'll produce a nonidentifiable model, which the new code will hopefully warn the user about.}
      Negative values exclude. Another special value is
      `LARGEST`, which will refer to the most frequent category, so,
      say, to set such a category as the baseline, pass
      `levels=-LARGEST`. In addition, `LARGEST(n)` will refer to the
      `n` largest categories. `SMALLEST` works analogously. Note that
      if there are ties in frequencies, they will be broken
      arbitrarily. To specify numeric or logical levels literally,
      wrap in `I()`.

\code{NULL}

: Retain all possible levels; usually equivalent to passing
      \code{TRUE}.

character vector

: Use as is.

function

: The function is called on the list of unique values of the
      attribute, the values of the attribute themselves, and the
      network itself, depending on its arity. Its return value is
      interpreted as above.

formula

: The expression on the right hand side of the formula is evaluated in an
      environment in which the network itself is accessible as
      \code{.nw}, the list of unique values of the attribute as
      \code{.} or as \code{.levels}, and the attribute vector itself
      as \code{.attr}. Its return value is interpreted as above.

Note that \code{levels} or \code{nodes} often has a default that is
sensible for the term in question.

Returning to the `faux.mesa.high` example, and treating `Grade` as a categorical variable, we can use a number of combinations:
```{r, node-attr-cats}
# Activity by grade with a baseline grade excluded:
summary(faux.mesa.high~nodefactor(~Grade))
# Retain all levels:
summary(faux.mesa.high~nodefactor(~Grade, levels=TRUE)) # or levels=NULL
# Use the largest grade as baseline (also Grade 7):
table(faux.mesa.high %v% "Grade")
summary(faux.mesa.high~nodefactor(~Grade, levels=-LARGEST))
# Collapse the smallest two grades (11 and 12) into a new category, 99.
library(magrittr) # For the %>% operator.
summary(faux.mesa.high~nodefactor((~Grade) %>% COLLAPSE_SMALLEST(2, 99)))

# Mixing between lower and upper grades:
summary(faux.mesa.high~mm(~Grade>=10))
# Mixing between grades 7 and 8 only:
summary(faux.mesa.high~mm("Grade", levels=I(c(7,8))))
# or
summary(faux.mesa.high~mm("Grade", levels=1:2))
# or using levels2 (see ? mm) to filter the combinations of levels,
summary(faux.mesa.high~mm("Grade",
        levels2=~sapply(.levels,
                        function(l)
                          l[[1]]%in%c(7,8) && l[[2]]%in%c(7,8))))
```

Generally, `levels2=` selects from among the combinations of levels selected by `levels=`. Here are some examples, using the attribute `Sex` (which as two levels):

```{r, node-attr-levels2}
# Here is the full list of combinations of sexes in an undirected network:
summary(faux.mesa.high~mm("Sex", levels2=TRUE))
# Select only the second combination:
summary(faux.mesa.high~mm("Sex", levels2=2))
# Equivalently,
summary(faux.mesa.high~mm("Sex", levels2=-c(1,3)))
# or
summary(faux.mesa.high~mm("Sex", levels2=c(FALSE,TRUE,FALSE)))
# Select all *but* the second one:
summary(faux.mesa.high~mm("Sex", levels2=-2))
# We can select via a mixing matrix: (Network is undirected and
# attributes are the same on both sides, so we can use either M or
# its transpose.)
(M <- matrix(c(FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE),2,2))
summary(faux.mesa.high~mm("Sex", levels2=M)+mm("Sex", levels2=t(M)))
# Select via an index of a cell:
idx <- cbind(1,2)
summary(faux.mesa.high~mm("Sex", levels2=idx))
```
