#' @param control A list of control parameters for algorithm tuning,
#'   typically constructed with <%=mycontrols%>, which have different
#'   defaults. Their documentation gives the the list of recognized
#'   control parameters and their meaning. The more generic utility
#'   [snctrl()] (StatNet ConTRoL) also provides argument completion
#'   for the available control functions and limited argument name
#'   checking.
