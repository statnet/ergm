#' @param node for level specification. The attribute and the sorted
#'   unique values are the vector of vertex indices `1:nb1` , where
#'   `nb1` is the size of the first bipartition. By default, `nodes=-1` means that the statistic for the
#'   first node will be omitted, but this argument may be changed to control
#'   which statistics are included. See Specifying Vertex attributes and Levels (`?nodal_attributes`) for details.)
