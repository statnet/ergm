   This data structure represents a block whose margins are NodeLists, which may
   be dynamic. It supports calculation of dyad count (including directedness and
   diagonal information) and extraction of a dyad at a specified doubled index.
   (Indices are doubled to keep things rectangular for diagonal, undirected blocks,
   whose unique dyads form a triangle.)
