#' Initializes the parameters to bound degree during sampling
#' 
#' Not normally called directly by user, \code{ergm.bounddeg} initializes the
#' list of parameters used to bound the degree during the Metropolis Hastings
#' sampling process, and issues warnings if the original network doesn't meet
#' the constraints specified by 'bounddeg'.
#' 
#' In some modeling situations, the degree of certain nodes are constrained to
#' lie in a certain range (rather than their theoretically possible range of 0
#' to n-1).  Such sample space constraints may be incorporated into the ergm
#' modeling process, and if so then the MCMC routine is prevented from visiting
#' network states that violate any of these bounds.
#' 
#' In case there are categories of nodes and degree bounds for each set of
#' categories, such constraints may be incorporated as well.  For instance, if
#' the nodes are girls and boys, and there is a maximum of 5 out-ties to boys
#' and a maximum of 5 out-ties to girls for each node, we would define p to be
#' 2, and the nxp matrix attribs would have TRUE in the first column (say) for
#' exactly those nodes that are boys and TRUE in the second column for only the
#' girls.  The maxout matrix would consist of all 5s in this case, and the
#' other arguments would be left as their default values.
#' 
#' Since the observed network is generally the beginning of the Markov chain,
#' it must satisfy all of the degree constraints itself; thus, this function
#' returns an error message if any bound is violated by the observed network.
#' 
#' @param arguments the `arguments` argument passed to the `InitErgmProposal.*()` function; the sub-sublist `arguments$constraints$bd` should be a list of parameters which may contain the following for a
#' network of size n nodes: \itemize{ \item attribs: an nxp matrix, where entry
#' ij is TRUE if node i has attribute j, and FALSE otherwise; default=an nx1
#' matrix of 1's \item maxout : an nxp matrix, where entry ij is the maximum
#' number of out degrees for node i to nodes with attribute j; default=an nxp
#' matrix of the value (n-1) \item maxin : defined similarly to maxout, but
#' ignored for undirected networks; default=an nxp matrix of the value (n-1)
#' \item minout : defined similarly to maxout; default=an nxp matrix of 0's
#' \item minin : defined similarly to maxout, but ignored for undirected
#' networks; default=an nxp matrix of 0's }
#' @param nw the orginal \code{network} specified to \code{ergm} in 'formula'
#' @return a list of parameters used to bound degree during sampling
