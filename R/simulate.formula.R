#' A `simulate` Method for `formula` objects that dispatches based on the Left-Hand Side
#'
#' This method evaluates the left-hand side (LHS) of the given formula and
#' dispatches it to an appropriate method based on the result by
#' setting an nonce class name on the formula.
#'
#' @param object a one- or two-sided [`formula`].
#' @param nsim,seed number of realisations to simulate and the random
#'   seed to use; see [simulate()].
#' @param ... additional arguments to methods.
#' @param basis if given, overrides the LHS of the formula for the
#'   purposes of dispatching.
#' @param newdata,data if passed, the `object`'s LHS is evaluated in
#'   this environment; at most one of the two may be passed.
#'
#' The dispatching works as follows:
#'
#' 1. If `basis` is not passed, and the formula has an LHS the
#'    expression on the LHS of the formula in the `object` is
#'    evaluated in the environment `newdata` or `data` (if given), in
#'    any case enclosed by the environment of `object`. Otherwise,
#'    `basis` is used.
#' 
#' 1. The result is set as an attribute `".Basis"` on `object`. If
#'    there is no `basis` or LHS, it is not set.
#' 
#' 1. The class vector of `object` has `c("formula_lhs_\var{CLASS}",
#'    "formula_lhs")` prepended to it, where \var{CLASS} is the class
#'    of the LHS value or `basis`. If LHS or `basis` has multiple
#'    classes, they are all prepended; if there is no LHS or `basis`,
#'    `c("formula_lhs_", "formula_lhs")` is.
#' 
#' 1. [simulate()] generic is evaluated on the new `object`, with all
#'    arguments passed on, excluding `basis`; if `newdata` or `data`
#'    are missing, they too are not passed on. The evaluation takes
#'    place in the parent's environment.
#'
#' A "method" to receive a formula whose LHS evaluates to \var{CLASS}
#' can therefore be implemented by a function
#' `simulate.formula_lhs_\var{CLASS}()`. This function can expect a
#' [`formula`] object, with additional attribute `.Basis` giving the
#' evaluated LHS (so that it does not need to be evaluated again).
#'
#' @seealso [simulate.ergm()] family of functions, which uses this interface.
